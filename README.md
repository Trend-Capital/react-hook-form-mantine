# React-Hook-Form-Mantine

React-Hook-Form-Mantine is a library that simplifies the integration of Mantine components with React Hook Form. By adding a "name" prop to Mantine components, the library seamlessly connects them to the corresponding form field.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install @franzen-dev/react-hook-form-mantine
```

## Attribution

Huge shout-out to @aranlucas for the original idea and implementation of this library; however, since that project has largely gone unmaintained for two years, including all attempts to create pull-requests to update dependencies, I decided to fork the project and update things myself.
